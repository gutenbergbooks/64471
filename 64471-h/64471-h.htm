A SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1 <span
class="smcap">John</span> i. 5. iv. 16.<br />
&ldquo;<i>God is Light</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>God is
Love</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Round</span> these two centres revolves
the Theology of St. John.</p>
<p>He is named &ldquo;the Divine,&rdquo; the Theologian; and this
is his scheme of Theology, his system of Divinity; not an
enumeration of doctrines, not an enunciation of Articles, not
Calvinism, not Arminianism, not Romanism, and not Protestantism;
but just these two principles, higher and deeper than any
question which divides parties or distinguishes sects: the first,
&ldquo;God is Light,&rdquo; and the second, &ldquo;God is
Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are not saying, God forbid! that two brief maxims, one a
metaphor, the other an abstraction, in such sense comprehend
Theology as that there shall be no need of express declarations
of fact, or of definite revelations of truth, beside or beyond,
within or above, them.&nbsp; Nor are we saying&mdash;this, too,
would be ignorance, as much as irreverence&mdash;that this very
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Epistle of
St. John is destitute of method or system or logical coherence;
consists only of a few platitudes and a few tautologies, the
amiable feeblenesses of a pious old age, encouraging the
scoffer&rsquo;s notion that there is nothing in religion but what
comes naturally to every man, whether to originate, to utter, to
judge, or to refuse.&nbsp; Of St. John&rsquo;s writings, more
perhaps than of any part of Holy Scripture, is the Divine saying
true, &ldquo;Thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
which to the self-sufficient critic is a simplicity bordering on
the puerile, is to the experienced Christian rather a profound
mystery, of which the Holy Spirit of God keeps the key.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; &ldquo;God is Light.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In Him is
no darkness at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is the Light of truth, and
the Light of holiness, and the Light of direction, and the Light
of comfort.&nbsp; Where He, who is the Light, shines not, or
shines only in some dim reflection&mdash;of Nature, or reason, or
conscience, or tradition; not directly, not personally, not in
Christ as the Saviour, not in the Holy Ghost as the
Comforter&mdash;there is darkness; darkness four-fold, like the
light&mdash;the darkness of ignorance, and the darkness of
corruption, and the darkness of error, and the darkness of
misery.&nbsp; &ldquo;God is Light,&rdquo;&mdash;and the purpose
of Light is to shine: but the light itself may be set under a
bushel, or the thick walls, the opaque windows, of the
soul&rsquo;s dwelling may shut it out.&nbsp; Vice, superstition,
false religion, cowardice, indifference, law itself, may bar the
entrance of Him <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>who is the Light.&nbsp; Such power is the mystery of
mysteries in the present: how God should be Light, and yet the
darkness may refuse to let the Light in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God is Light&rdquo;&mdash;first and before all
else.&nbsp; They who would know God must know Him thus.&nbsp; No
other attribute, no other manifestation, can be substituted for
this or prefixed to it.&nbsp; Attempts have been made to displace
it.&nbsp; To put, for example, the second text first&mdash;love
before light; or something else&mdash;obedience, docility,
humility, patience.&nbsp; It will not answer.&nbsp; The
transposition bewrays itself by the failure.&nbsp; &ldquo;God is
Light,&rdquo; and he who would know God must first come to Him as
the Light.</p>
<p>Some have said, A half-light is better than none.&nbsp; Better
twilight than thick darkness.&nbsp; So far we agree with
them.&nbsp; But when they have gone on to recommend an
acquiescence&mdash;temporary at least, prudential,
deferential&mdash;in the half-light; when they have spoken of the
necessity of preparation for the full light, of the peril of
precipitating illumination, of the duty of forecasting probable
consequences&mdash;such as a disarrangement of existing habits
and systems, an exposure of errors, an unmasking of
superstitions, before we have the machinery ready for the
education and for the fostering of the man isolated by the very
enlightenment&mdash;then we say, God is Light, and there is no
communion between light and darkness.&nbsp; Prudence is out of
place where the question is of the Divine
self-manifestation.&nbsp; At all risks God must shine, and God
must be trusted to take care of His shining.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Man, by
God&rsquo;s gift, has a right to the light.&nbsp; As well might
you portion off one strip or one chink of the sky, and say to
your dependant, I forbid you the rest of it&mdash;as well might
you shut up within prison walls a man who had done you no wrong,
and tell him that candle or rushlight was good enough for him to
see by&mdash;as undertake to settle for one class or one tribe or
one race of mankind the amount of Divine illumination which shall
suffice for them, on the plea that to give more might disturb
existing arrangements of civil or religious polity, or that until
you could provide the culture you must hesitate to give the
life.&nbsp; God dealt not thus with us, when He lit the flame of
reviving light in this nation of England.&nbsp; First He brought
into it, in this house and that, in this heart and that, the
new-found, the dearly-prized treasure of His Word read in the
tongue wherein we were born; and then He gave the new-made man a
Reformed Communion in which to worship.&nbsp; &ldquo;God is
Light,&rdquo; and they who know God must fearlessly let in upon
others the light communicated to themselves.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; For, indeed, brethren, the second text is the
mouthpiece and interpreter of the former.&nbsp; &ldquo;God is
Love.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Light is no distant, self-contained,
abstract thing&mdash;like a science or a philosophy which men may
study if they will, but which comes not forth itself to invite or
to embrace its votary.&nbsp; The Light of which St. John speaks,
the Light which is God, has another name besides&mdash;a name
which describes it as offering, volunteering, entreating
sympathy&mdash;<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>a name which expresses the yearning of a heart, and the
stretching out of a hand, towards an object of concern,
compassion, and commiseration.&nbsp; If &ldquo;God is
Light&rdquo; be ambiguous as a direction, &ldquo;God is
Love&rdquo; speaks plainly, and is no proverb.&nbsp; That voice,
wheresoever it is heard&mdash;that voice, which is articulate
only in the Gospel&mdash;has set in motion palsied limbs, and
quickened dead souls, in the transmission and propagation of a
Divine Light.&nbsp; &ldquo;Si documentum qu&aelig;ris,
circumspice!&rdquo;&nbsp; This day, this scene, this assembly, is
the proof of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I looked, and behold, an hand was
sent unto me; and lo, a roll of a book was therein.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The hand was the Hand of Love, and the book was the Book of
Light.</p>
<p>The Book was the Book of Light.&nbsp; When you hold it, as
this day, closed in your hand; not opening it, for
interpretation&mdash;that is not your office&mdash;but carrying
it forth closed for another to open; when you think of it as a
whole, gathering into one the scattered rays of its light, that
you may say in a word why it is that you are devoting time and
toil and substance to its dissemination; this, I think, will be
your account of it.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; The Bible is the revelation to me of a living
God.&nbsp; And by a living God, I mean a God whose life is
towards me: not such a life as that which Elijah sketched in
mockery as the life of Baal&mdash;a kind of life which made him
deaf to man&rsquo;s cry; a life separate and selfish and
distant&mdash;talking, pursuing, journeying, per-adventure
sleeping.&nbsp; The very opposite of this.&nbsp; A God <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>whose activity
is towards this world.&nbsp; A God whose eye and whose ear is
ever open to the conduct and condition of His
creatures&mdash;whose vigilance never tires, and yet is a
vigilance even more of concern than of observation.&nbsp; One
whom I cannot escape from if I would, but whose inevitable
Presence is the very cause of my strength, my motion, my
being.&nbsp; The revelation of a personal God is the first gift
of this Bible.&nbsp; So intent is the Bible upon this work, that
it risks many taunts, many misconstructions, in securing
it.&nbsp; It is so earnest to make me see God in everything, that
it cares not if it seems to say, God does everything that
happens; even hardens the enemy&rsquo;s heart, even sends the
error which infatuates, even commissions the lying spirit, or
punishes the prophet for going where he was bidden.&nbsp; The
Bible risks these things&mdash;leaves them to be corrected by
opposite sayings, or by the intuitions of that conscience to
which it addresses itself&mdash;that it may at least effect
this&mdash;make me see God, hear God, be conscious of God,
everywhere and in all things; assure me that nothing is, with
God, either too great for His control, or too little for His
notice, if it affects me&mdash;my welfare, my happiness, my work,
or my end.&nbsp; Anything, anything, says the voice of the Light,
rather than a God too great to act, or a God too sublime to
feel!&nbsp; Say at once, Where God is, He works.&nbsp; Call upon
Him in thy prosperity, that He may bless thee; call upon Him in
the time of trouble, so shall He hear thee, and thou shalt praise
Him!</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>(2)&nbsp;
The Bible is the revelation to me of a Divine Saviour.&nbsp; I
carry about me, I carry within me, a burden of guilt and
sin.&nbsp; Ignore this, in thy dealing with me&mdash;and however
eloquent, however wise, however lofty thy counsels, they touch me
not, they address not me.&nbsp; Recognize this when thou speakest
to me of a God around and above me; and however humble, however
simple, however human thy monitions, they find me out, they
penetrate me, they thrill me through and through, because they
deal with me as I am, and they tell me of that which I
want.&nbsp; The Book of Light is the revelation of a
Saviour.&nbsp; From its first page to its latest, it is the
testimony of Jesus.&nbsp; When I see this, all is made
plain.&nbsp; Patriarchs, and lawgivers, and psalmists, and
prophets, and kings, all, if they are in God&rsquo;s Book, point
on to, or point back to, Jesus.&nbsp; Descriptions of life,
personal and national&mdash;records of sins and vices and
crimes&mdash;narratives of wrath and mercy, of judgment and
restoration&mdash;even details of ordinance and ritual, which
were else trivial or wearisome&mdash;become instinct with
meaning, brilliant with beauty, when I read them in the Book of
Light, because I know that there they all speak of Jesus, and add
something&mdash;something real, definite, tangible&mdash;to the
hope of pardon and acceptance which is bound up for me in
Him.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; The Bible is the revelation to me of an everlasting
Heaven.&nbsp; We cannot exaggerate the power of that word.&nbsp;
The experiences of this life are various for man and man: for
most men they are various <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>from period to period of the unit
life.&nbsp; We say not whether, on the whole&mdash;taking the
average of men, and the average also of the life&mdash;it is
better, if earth were all, to have been or not to have
been.&nbsp; But one thing is certain&mdash;that this earth is
not, cannot be, for the most fortunate, either rest or
satisfaction.&nbsp; Death alone would forbid that.&nbsp; Change,
decay, separation&mdash;separation of hearts yet more than of
lives&mdash;discords and discrepancies making union here
impossible&mdash;would alone make a man write &ldquo;vanity of
vanities&rdquo; upon his tomb.&nbsp; It is this, it is this above
all, which gives the Bible its power.&nbsp; It reveals
Heaven.&nbsp; It tells of an immortality which shall reconcile
differences; an immortality which shall redress wrongs; an
immortality which shall re-unite the severed, and knit all hearts
in one, in the haven, and in the Heaven, and in the Heart, of
God.&nbsp; Marvel not if a Book possessing this secret is a Book
omnipotent over the affections of mankind.&nbsp; Believe it, and
life takes a new colour.&nbsp; If the hand of love carries this
roll, it comes indeed for the healing of the nations!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Hand of Love bears the Book of Light.</p>
<p>Quite inexplicable, without love, the scene before us this
day.&nbsp; Philanthropy, without the Gospel, was not.&nbsp;
Charity herself is the creation of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; How much
more that charity which is the love of souls!</p>
<p>This Society, now keeping her sixty-eighth birthday, has
chosen a distinct province.&nbsp; I would commend her <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>to you,
brethren&mdash;nay, you are here because you love her&mdash;on
two special grounds.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; She is the witness&mdash;as such, God has owned
her&mdash;to the primary importance of the spiritual life.&nbsp;
Light first, then love.&nbsp; Illumination the condition of
union.&nbsp; First the quickening, then the combination.&nbsp;
First the spirit, then the body.&nbsp; First the soul, then the
Church.</p>
<p>The argument is sometimes turned against us.&nbsp; You set
aside the Church.&nbsp; You treat the individual as though he
were a unit.&nbsp; You wait not for priest or presbyter; you
intrude yourself between the man and the community; you care not
if you even sow discord&mdash;if you even make a man see the lie
in the Church&rsquo;s right hand.&nbsp; What if one of your
agents offer your Book&mdash;Divine, of course, it is&mdash;to a
man prohibited by rule and censure from reading it?&nbsp; What
if, as he reads thus against order your Divine Book, he should
perceive, in some point or in many points, the hollowness, the
nakedness of the system in which he has been brought up?&nbsp;
What if you pass on, and leave him an isolated man, a separatist,
a schismatic, where before he was the member of a body?&nbsp; And
you have done this of the self-will, of the separate schismatical
action, which is a feature of your organization!</p>
<p>The charge is&mdash;let us understand it&mdash;that in
offering the light promiscuously, we set the Bible above the
Church.&nbsp; We ought to have waited till Rome gave
leave&mdash;till Rome unsaid her saying&mdash;till the
unchangeable system changed itself&mdash;till Rome gave the Word
of God free course amongst her people!&nbsp; Till then, <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>we can only
give light at the cost of love.&nbsp; We divide, we dissever, we
isolate, the life from the communion.&nbsp; We leave the man
taught of God an Ishmael among his brethren.</p>
<p>Brethren! we are not careful to answer concerning this
matter.&nbsp; If it be so; if the possession of light be
anywhere, in any Christian community, contraband; if a Church
prohibits the Bible; if a member of that Church, possessing a
Bible, reads in it that Church&rsquo;s rebuke; if at last, trying
all means of subordination, he must take his choice between his
God and his Church&mdash;we did not suggest it; we did all we
could to harmonize and to reconcile; we even took Rome&rsquo;s
Version, and bade him read out of it the words of life; we know
how earnestly the Bible presses communion&mdash;how strong will
be the pressure upon its student, not to live alone, not to
isolate himself&mdash;on the very contrary, to feel, to cherish,
to insist upon Church membership&mdash;but if&mdash;if the Book
of Light does condemn, in the man&rsquo;s conscience, the Church
of his birth and of his Baptism&mdash;can we, ought we, to lie to
him?&nbsp; Can we, ought we, to withhold the light, lest haply
the light should condemn?&nbsp; The light of God is the right of
mankind; the hand of love must offer it!</p>
<p>This Society is, we frankly say, a witness to the primary
importance of the individual life.&nbsp; It is God&rsquo;s
order.&nbsp; Out of the individual&mdash;not the other
way&mdash;grows the community.&nbsp; It was so at Jerusalem, it
was so at Damascus, it was so at Antioch, it was so at Philippi,
it was so at Ephesus, it was so at Rome.&nbsp; It was so&mdash;<a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>to come
nearer home&mdash;in England, in London, at Oxford, at
Gloucester, at Paul&rsquo;s Cross, and in Smithfield fires.&nbsp;
All God&rsquo;s mightiest works of grace have sprung out of
individual convictions.&nbsp; To wait till an irreversible
judgment is reversed&mdash;to wait till a bigoted and tyrannical
Church invites her members to read and to hear, to meditate and
to judge&mdash;is, in other words, to decide that God&rsquo;s
truth shall wait man&rsquo;s convenience, that souls shall live
out their days ignorant of the Word that (through grace)
quickens!</p>
<p>My brethren, we but return to primitive usage, when we claim
this prerogative, this majesty, for the Book of God.&nbsp; Dear
in all ages has this writing been to the heart of the
Church&rsquo;s martyrs and the Church&rsquo;s saints.&nbsp; It is
a new view, this, of the right of a community to stand between a
man and his Bible!&nbsp; Surely it is a putting of proprieties
and decorums in the place of truth and experience and the one
thing needful.&nbsp; Is it thus that God acts?&nbsp; What
greatest of God&rsquo;s works has been wrought by method and
rule?&nbsp; Cornelius and his assemblage receiving the Holy Ghost
before Baptism is a type, surely, for every age, of the manner in
which God Himself, in the free, unfettered breathing of His
Divine Spirit, passes by at His will the mechanism of order, and
reveals Himself in the liberty of an elemental strength.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; But while we assert thus earnestly the supremacy of
conscience, and the right of the individual man to the possession
of the Book of Light, we would also, and not less earnestly,
commend to you this great <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Society as the servant and the
minister of all the Churches.</p>
<p>Very touching is it, to Christian hearts, to read the simple
record of her ministrations in this chief capacity.&nbsp; The
destitution of the Church in Wales called her into
existence.&nbsp; The Church in Ireland had been for more than a
century without an edition of a complete native Bible, when she
interposed.&nbsp; The fortunes of Continental nations have their
reflection in her history.&nbsp; The wars of the first French
Revolution are chronicled in her account-books.&nbsp; Her first
French Bible was printed for the prisoners of war in 1805.&nbsp;
Through her efforts, in the same disastrous time, hundreds of
Spanish captives might be seen in prison yards reading in their
own tongue the living, life-giving Word.&nbsp; The great
Abolition Act of 1834 suggested the gift of the New Testament to
a hundred thousand of the then emancipated slaves.&nbsp; The
Spanish Revolution of 1868 opened a new country to the Gospel,
and has spread already two hundred thousand copies of the Holy
Scriptures among the people of that still distracted and
storm-tossed land.&nbsp; The consolidation of Italy&mdash;last of
all, the erection of a constitutional throne on the Roman Capitol
itself&mdash;has been followed by the formation of a new Bible
Society, to which we give the right hand of fellowship, and hope
ere long to resign the field which is her own.&nbsp; The
protracted agonies of a yet nearer neighbour, under a succession
of strokes and plagues unexampled in history, have been soothed
by the holy <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>offices of this Society, extending, alike to
Imperialist, Republican, Communist prisoner, the comfort, in his
hour of distress, of that Book not of this world, which at once
blesses earth and opens Heaven.&nbsp; Not a country, not a
province, escapes the notice of that vigilant eye, which watches
from the shores of England each door opened by the Providence of
God for the entry of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; No
Society, of this Church or that, for Christian Missions, can
dispense with her aid in furnishing the divine material.&nbsp; In
two hundred and fifty Versions, of the languages and dialects
spoken on the face of this earth by nations of the great
dispersion, more than one hundred millions of copies of
God&rsquo;s Word have been issued, or aided in the issuing, by
this marvellous agency of evangelization.</p>
<p>Brethren! an organization thus blessed, thus vivified, by the
Omnipotent Hand, stands no longer on the defensive in the
battle-field of Christianity.&nbsp; One by one, unfriendly voices
are silenced.&nbsp; One by one, enemies are becoming
friends.&nbsp; Already the reverend rulers of our own Church,
with comparatively few exceptions, have seen their way to
sympathy and co-operation.&nbsp; It was ungrateful&mdash;I know
it was involuntary&mdash;to accept help for all manner of Church
action, and to refuse thanks, or even recognition, to the hands
which bountifully supplied it.&nbsp; We thank God, those days are
past.&nbsp; Without ceasing to be the handmaid of all Churches,
the British and Foreign Bible Society is certainly the <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>friend, the
&ldquo;deaconess,&rdquo; of one.&nbsp; Your presence to-day in
this great Metropolitan Cathedral&mdash;where so lately Royalty
itself bowed the knee, in thanksgiving for a precious life
restored, to the all-ruling Majesty in the heavens&mdash;proves
that your work is regarded and honoured, as it ought to be, by
that great National Church of England, of which you are all, I
well know, either dutiful members or else cordial
well-wishers.</p>
<p>Thus our tried and honoured Society sets out on another year
of anxious, responsible, yet (under God) most hopeful
service.&nbsp; We give thanks to-day, we pray also to-day, for
this mighty bulwark&mdash;it is so&mdash;of the national
prosperity!&nbsp; Every largest, every humblest offering, of time
or wealth, of effort or sympathy, given to her, is given, be ye
well assured, to England&rsquo;s honour, to England&rsquo;s
strength, to England&rsquo;s prosperity.&nbsp; The land of the
Bible is a land of light, a land of peace, and a land of
liberty.&nbsp; Nations may war for fame or supremacy, for
treasure or territory, for frontier or empire&mdash;war may breed
war, and an iron heel alone coerce the savage writhings of an
implacable foe&mdash;England&rsquo;s peace, England&rsquo;s
honour, is in surer safe-keeping, so long as she acknowledges the
Christ of the Bible, and suffers not a creeping infidelity to
seduce her from the allegiance of the life-giving God.</p>
<p>But Oh, brethren, let us not be highminded, but fear!&nbsp;
Let us not boast ourselves in our light nor in our freedom!&nbsp;
Let us not count but weigh our safeguards!&nbsp; Let us make
large allowance for waste, <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>even in our blessings!&nbsp; Holy
Scripture is multiplied among us, till it is a very proverb of
cheapness&mdash;see that there be not, concerning it, at once an
arrogance and a despite!&nbsp; Is the Bible dear to your hearts,
as well as plentiful in your homes?&nbsp; Do you not only fight
for it, but wrestle with God over it?&nbsp; Do you draw from it,
not your weapons of attack, but your helmet and your shield and
your breastplate?&nbsp; In these days you sorely need them.&nbsp;
Remember how only (St. Paul says) we can wield the Spirit&rsquo;s
sword&mdash;even by praying always in the Spirit.&nbsp; Take to
your heart the words of a great orator of our time, speaking, as
a Catholic Priest, in the very centre and focus of Romanism, in
behalf&mdash;strange, strange, strange phenomenon&mdash;in behalf
of a new Bible Society for Italy!&mdash;&ldquo;Catholics and
Protestants, but all Christians, behold, we are united in this
city, which has been the cause of our separation!&nbsp; This Book
is our bond of union. . . .&nbsp; We are all children of the
Bible, but we are fallen, divided, powerless. . . .&nbsp; The
Bible has been neglected. . . .&nbsp; The life of the Church is
the life of the soul in Christ, and of Christ in the soul. . .
.&nbsp; Direct and vital dealings with God&rsquo;s Word will give
reality to our religious life, and will defend us alike from
scepticism and from superstition. . . .&nbsp; A day is
coming&mdash;and my heart tells me it is not far off&mdash;in
which the question shall not be whether men are Roman Catholics,
or Greek Catholics, or Lutheran Protestants, or Reformed
Protestants, but only whether they are true Catholics, and, above
all, true Christians. . . .&nbsp; <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>We shall enter the city of God, Bible
in hand, singing in every language, and in every denominational
peculiarity, but with one faith and with one heart: and that city
of our unity shall be called the city of Peace, for it shall be,
as saith the Prophet, the city of Truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is God&rsquo;s order: Truth first, then Peace: Light
first, then Love; Love out of, because of, the Light.</p>
<p>May God, of His infinite mercy, realize that hope, grant that
prayer, in His time&mdash;and bring us all, in the knowledge of
the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the
stature of the fulness of Christ!</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

  works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
